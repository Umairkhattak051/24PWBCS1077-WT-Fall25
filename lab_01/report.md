# Lab 01 Report___Summary

During this lab, I learned the basics of Git and GitHub by creating, editing, and managing files inside a repository.  
I practiced committing changes with meaningful messages and pushing them to a remote repository.  
I also explored how to use `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files and how to add a license to a project.  
Working with branches was very helpful because I learned how to make experimental changes without affecting the main project, and later merge them safely.  
Overall, this lab improved my understanding of version control and gave me hands-on experience in managing a project using Git.
